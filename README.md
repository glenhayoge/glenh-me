## Deprecation Notes

-   Contentlayer is effectively unmaintained. The project cannot be used with next.js 14+ due to dependency conflicts so I have currently switched over to using next-contentlayer2 (a fork of contentLayer) instead.
-   I'm currently using next-themes instead of tailwind-merge.
-   I'm currently using rehype-prism-plus instead of rehype-prism.
-   I have updated the code to use NextJS from 13.2.0 to 15.3.3.
