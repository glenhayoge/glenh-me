Unemployed youths have a choice: they can use their hands to earn a living through productive agri-business enterprises or misuse their potential, leading to self-destruction or harm to others.\n\nIndeed, farming to earn a bank card is not for the faint-hearted. It requires hard work and dedication, as evidenced by the calluses on his hands.\n\nHe showed me that our hands, when used for the right purposes, can be like a bank card, opening doors to success and prosperity. Our land holds the potential to be our biggest employer, providing opportunities for a better future.",
