To insert an image in an MDX format article in Next.js using Contentlayer, use the standard Markdown image syntax. 

```
![Alt text for the image](/path/to/your/image.jpg)
```

Replace ```/path/to/your/image.jpg``` with the actual path to an image file, and adjust the caption text accordingly. This structure provides a semantic way to include an image with its caption in your MDX document.

Use the standard HTML syntax for image captions. Wrap your image and its caption in a `<figure>` element, and use the `<figcaption>` element to provide the caption.

Adjust the dimensions (height and width) of the image in Markdown by using HTML attributes within the `<img>` tag.

Example Code:

```
<figure> <img src="/path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Alt text for the image" width="500" height="300" /> <figcaption>Caption for your image.</figcaption> </figure>
```

Adjust the values to your preferred dimensions. It's important to maintain the aspect ratio of the image to prevent distortion. If you set only one of ```width``` or ```height```, the browser will automatically adjust the other dimension to maintain the aspect ratio.

Remember to replace ```/path/to/your/image.jpg``` with the actual path to your image file, and customize the caption accordingly.
