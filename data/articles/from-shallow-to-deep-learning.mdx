When you delve into the stories of successful individuals, a common thread you will find is their unwavering commitment to lifelong learning. As Oliver Wendell Holmes beautifully put it, **"A mind stretched by a new experience can never shrink back to its previous dimensions."**

Nishant Kasibhatla, a renowned speaker and trainer, reminds us, **"Your ability to learn determines your earning capacity."** By learning quickly, you can transition from an underpaid position to an overcompensated one, gaining a unique advantage over your peers.

#### But how does one achieve that?

The learning process begins with an **'input'**. However, the problem lies in the fact that many of us overemphasize this aspect. 

#### What is input? 

An input encompasses activities like reading books, attending seminars, participating in training workshops, following blogs, watching YouTube videos, and reading social media posts. These activities certainly aren't harmful, but when the balance shifts towards an excess of input and a deficiency of output, we land in the realm of '**shallow learning**'.

I've attended numerous seminars, webinars, and training workshops - you name it. I was under the illusion that I was truly learning, but more often than not, it seemed to serve as intellectual entertainment. Certificates of attendance merely served as physical evidence of my participation in these **'input'** events, subtly fostering an illusion of competence in my mind.

#### But what's the point of learning if we can't put it into practice?

We squander countless hours on shallow learning, which is input-focused, when our emphasis should be on deep learning. Deep learning is centered on output - the implementation of what we have gathered during the input process.

Nishant Kasibhatla articulates, **"For true mastery, your focus should be more on the OUTPUT rather than the INPUT."**

So, when learning something new, it's essential to give it your full attention. Turn off your phone, silence those attention-grabbing notifications. Follow the cycle of learning, reflecting, implementing, and sharing. This practice will lead you to true understanding and mastery.
