I stumbled upon [Spartan/ui](https://www.spartan.ng/)  in  [Josh Morony's](https://www.joshmorony.com/)  newsletter (Josh remains my main go-to resource person for everything Angular) recently and have decided to give it a spin to see what it has got to offer to Angular developers. 

According to the author of Spartan UI - [Robin Goetz](https://ui.shadcn.com/)- Spartan UI is  [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) like collection of un-styled and accessible ( [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) ) Angular UI primitives (**The building blocks of your UI**). 

The two major parts of the building blocks of Spartan/ui are the **Brain** and the **Helm**:

1. The **spartan/ui/brain** offers a versatile collection of **un-styled** UI building blocks that can be easily tailored to match your project's distinct visual and functional preferences.
2. The **spartan/ui/helm** provides pre-designed styles built on **TailwindCSS** and **CSS variables**. Just like with **shadcn**, the styles can be copied to projects with full control code, appearance, and overall experience.

### Setting up

**spartan/ui** comes equipped with [Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/**intro) plugin and integrates easily into Nx workspace. A single command can add any of its **30 spartan/ui primitives** to projects.

Let's get our hands dirty and see how spartan/ui looks like.

1. Begin by creating a new Angular project inside Nx workspace by running the command below:

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```

### Using spartan/ui in your project

Once you have a new Nx workspace set up, you can install the spartan/ui package using the following command:

`npm install --save spartan/ui`

This will install the spartan/ui package and its dependencies into your project.

### Importing spartan/ui components

Once the `spartan/ui` package is installed, you can start importing the components you need into your Angular components. For example, to import the Button component, you can use the following code:

```
import { Button } from 'spartan/ui';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```

### Using spartan/ui components in your templates

With the Button component imported, you can now use it in your Angular templates. For example, the following code snippet shows how to use the Button component to create a simple button:

```
<button spartanButton>Click me</button>
```
This code will create a button with the text "Click me".

Spartan/ui is a promising new Angular UI library that offers a collection of un-styled and accessible UI components. The library is easy to use and integrates well with Nx workspaces. With its focus on customization and accessibility, Spartan/ui is a great option for developers who want to create unique and user-friendly Angular applications.

I hope this article has given you a good introduction to Spartan/ui. For more information, please refer to the references below.
