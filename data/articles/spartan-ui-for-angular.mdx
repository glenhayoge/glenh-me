I stumbled upon [Spartan/ui](https://www.spartan.ng/)  in  [Josh Morony's](https://www.joshmorony.com/)  newsletter (Josh remains my main go-to resource person for everything Angular) recently and have decided to give it a spin to see what it has got to offer to Angular developers. 

According to the author of Spartan UI - [Robin Goetz](https://ui.shadcn.com/)- Spartan UI is  [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) like collection of un-styled and accessible ( [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) ) Angular UI primitives (**The building blocks of your UI**). 

The two major parts of the building blocks of Spartan/ui are the **Brain** and the **Helm**:

1. The **spartan/ui/brain** offers a versatile collection of **un-styled** UI building blocks that can be easily tailored to match your project's distinct visual and functional preferences.
2. The **spartan/ui/helm** provides pre-designed styles built on **TailwindCSS** and **CSS variables**. Just like with **shadcn**, the styles can be copied to projects with full control code, appearance, and overall experience.

### Setting up

**spartan/ui** comes equipped with [Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/**intro) plugin and integrates easily into Nx workspace. A single command can add any of its **30 spartan/ui primitives** to projects.

Let's get our hands dirty and see how spartan/ui looks like.

1. Begin by creating a new Angular project inside Nx workspace by running the command below:

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```
