### Introduction

Public speaking is more than just delivering words to an audience; it's about sharing ideas, inspiring change, and persuading people. One of the biggest challenges speakers face is structuring their message in a way that is engaging, clear, and memorable. The **STAR** technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result) offers a simple yet powerful framework to achieve this. By breaking down complex ideas into a logical, cause-and-effect structure, STAR helps speakers tell compelling stories that resonate with their audience.

### What is the STAR Technique?

The STAR technique is commonly used in storytelling, job interviews, and persuasive speaking to present ideas in a clear and engaging manner. It helps make messages more relatable and memorable by organizing real-life examples into a logical sequence.

Originally developed as a structured approach for answering behavioral interview questions, STAR was introduced by interview coaches and HR professionals to help candidates provide clear and concise responses to competency-based questions. It gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as part of behavioral interviewing techniques, influenced by research in industrial and organizational psychology. Today, major organizations like Google, Amazon, and the US government use it in their hiring processes.

Over time, the STAR technique has evolved beyond job interviews and is now widely used in public speaking, storytelling, and problem-solving across various fields.

At its core, STAR follows a natural storytelling pattern:

- **Situation**: Set the stage by describing the context or background.
- **Task**: Define the challenge or problem that needs solving.
- **Action**: Explain the steps taken to address the issue.
- **Result**: Showcase the outcome and its impact.

This logical sequence mirrors how our brains understand cause and effect, making it intuitive and easy to follow.

### Why is STAR Effective for Public Speaking?

The STAR structure aligns with how humans process stories, making it a fundamental cognitive pattern:

1. **Context first** (Situation)

2. **Problem second** (Task)

3. **Process third** (Action)

4. **Conclusion last** (Result)

This technique is effective because it enhances:

- **Clarity** – Ensures a well-organized and coherent message.

- **Engagement** – Follows a natural storytelling arc, keeping the audience interested.

- **Retention** – Uses a cause-effect structure, making the message easier to remember.

- **Persuasiveness** – Presents problems and solutions logically, which strengthens arguments.

By using STAR, a speaker can transform any idea, pitch, or argument into a digestible, story-driven format.

### How to Apply STAR in Public Speaking

You can use the STAR technique in various speaking scenarios, such as:

- **Persuasive speeches** (selling an idea, pitching an innovation)

- **Business presentations** (explaining strategies or solutions)

- **Job interviews** (answering behavioral questions)

- **Motivational Talks** (sharing personal or impactful stories)

### Example: Applying STAR to an Innovation Pitch

- **Situation:** Many smallholder farmers in Papua New Guinea struggle with poor access to agricultural advice. 
- **Task:** The challenge is providing expert farming guidance in real time. 
- **Action:** We developed a mobile app that delivers instant advice, AI-driven support, and real-time weather updates.
- **Result:** Farmers using the app have reported better crop yields and reduced losses, significantly improving rural incomes.

This structured approach ensures that your speech is clear, persuasive, and memorable, helping your audience grasp the key message effortlessly.

By mastering the STAR technique, you can elevate your public speaking skills and make a lasting impact with every speech you deliver.
