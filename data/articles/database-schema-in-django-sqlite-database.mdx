In Django, `db.sqlite3` is the default SQLite database file that is created when you initiate a new Django project. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained, and transactional SQL database engine.

When you start a new Django project, by default, it comes configured to use SQLite as its database backend. SQLite is suitable for development and small-scale applications, as it's lightweight and doesn't require a separate database server process.

A default default `db.sqlite3` databse configuration would look something like this in your Django `settings.py` file.

```
DATABASES = {

'default': {

'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',

'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),

}

}
```

`db.sqlite3` is an integral part of Django projects, particularly during development, and it represents the SQLite database that your Django project uses by default.

#### Reasons to view database schemas

Viewing the schema that Django created in the `db.sqlite3` database can be beneficial especially when you want to understand the database structure, debug and troubleshoot, check migration status, manipulate database manually, integrate with external tools and document  your database.

#### Common steps to access and view the database schema

The common approaches  to access and view the database schema are via the command line or by using a GUI database client browser.

##### Using command-line client

Navigate to the folder where your database is

And run the command below:

```
python manage.py dbshell
```

To access **sqlite3 command-line client** as shown below:

Then, run the command below:

```
.table
```

Or run the command below:

```
.tables
```

or run
```
.schema
```

depending on what you want. Instead of invoking sqlite3 directly you could do

To show all the tables in **SQLite** as shown below:

Then, run the command below:

```
.schema --indent store_product
```

To show **the schema of "store_product" table** as shown below:

<figure><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q98aF.png" alt="the schema of store_product"/> <figcaption>The schema of store_product</figcaption> </figure>

If you are working with a legacy database you can generate Django models for that using the

```
python manage.py inspectdb
```

##### Using GUI database client

A much easier way to access the database schema would be through a GUI database client

A popular GUI database browser client  is DB Browser

#### DB Browser

DB Browser for SQLite is a free tool (Open Source) that lets you create, edit, and manage SQLite databases easily. Whether you're a developer or a regular user, it simplifies tasks like creating, searching, and modifying databases. You don't need to know complex SQL statements because it has a user-friendly interface similar to a spreadsheet. You can download it for your operating system from [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).
