### Introduction

In this short tutorial we'll learn how to create links that smoothly scroll to specific sections of a NextJS web page when clicked. At the time of writing I am using Next.js version 14.1.4 but other versions should work as well.

### What to do?

Firstly define a reusable React component. I named it `ScrollLink` in this example. 

`// components/ScrollLink.jsx`

The links in this component will enable the users to scroll smoothly to a specified section of a webpage when clicked. 

### Code for the component

Code for the `ScrollLink` component:

```javascript

// components/ScrollLink.jsx

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

import Link from 'next/link';

  
function ScrollLink({ id, children }) {

const handleClick = (e) => {

e.preventDefault();

const element = document.getElementById(id);

if (element) {

element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });

}

};
return (

<Link href={`#${id}`} passHref>

<div onClick={handleClick}>{children}</div>

</Link>

);

}

export default ScrollLink;

```
### Code breakdown

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:


1. **Import Statements**:
    
    - `useState` and `useEffect` are imported from the React library. They are React hooks used for managing state and performing side effects in functional components.
    - `Link` is imported from the `next/link` module. It is used in Next.js for client-side navigation.

2. **Function Definition**:
    
    - `ScrollLink` is a functional component that takes two props: `id` and `children`.
    - `id` is the ID of the element to which the link should scroll.
    - `children` represents the content of the link.

3. **handleClick Function**:
    
    - This function is called when the link is clicked.
    - It prevents the default behavior of the link (navigating to a new page).
    - It retrieves the DOM element with the specified `id`.
    - If the element exists, it scrolls to it smoothly using `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`.

4. **Return Statement**:
    
    - The component returns a `Link` component from Next.js wrapped around a `div`.
    - The `href` attribute of the `Link` component is set to `#${id}`, which means clicking the link will navigate to the element with the specified `id` within the same page.
    - `passHref` is used to pass the `href` prop to the underlying `a` tag.
    - The `onClick` event of the `div` is set to the `handleClick` function.
    - The content of the link (`children`) is rendered inside the `div`.
    
5. **Export Statement**:
    
    - The `ScrollLink` component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Implementation Example

Make sure the target elements - sections or divs - have an **ID** attribute set to them properly

Let say we want to navigate to the `contacts` section:

```xml
<section id='contacts'>
 ...
</section>
```

1. Import the ScrollLink reusable component at the top of your navigation component:

```javascript
import ScrollLink from './ScrollLink';
```

2. Call the ScrollLink component and set your `id` property as `contacts` and the child `text` as `Contacts` in your navigation component:

```javascript
import ScrollLink from './ScrollLink';

const Navbar = () => {
return (
...
<ul>
<li>
<ScrollLink id="contacts">Contacts</ScrollLink>
</li>
</ul>
...
);

};
export default Navbar;
```

Implementing the above code correctly will enhancing the user experience of navigating within a single-page application.
