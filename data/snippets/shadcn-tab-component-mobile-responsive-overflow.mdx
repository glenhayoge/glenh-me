When you have many tabs in your shadcn/ui Tabs component, they might not all fit on the screen. Here's a simple workaround to make them responsive with horizontal scrolling.

## Create a scrollable container

Wrap your TabsList in a div that allows horizontal scrolling:

```bash
<div className="relative rounded-sm overflow-x-scroll h-10 bg-muted">
  {/* TabsList will go here */}
</div>
```

Place the TabsList inside the container and make it absolute:

## Make the TabsList absolute

```bash
<div className="relative rounded-sm overflow-x-scroll h-10 bg-muted">
  <TabsList className="absolute flex flex-row justify-stretch w-full">
    {/* TabsTriggers will go here */}
  </TabsList>
</div>
```
This allows the TabsList to extend beyond the visible area.

## Add TabsTriggers

Map through your tabs and create TabsTrigger components:

```bash
<div className="relative rounded-sm overflow-x-scroll h-10 bg-muted">
  <TabsList className="absolute flex flex-row justify-stretch w-full">
    {tabs.map((value, index) => (
      <TabsTrigger
        className="w-full"
        key={`tab_trigger_${index}`}
        value={value}
      >
        {value}
      </TabsTrigger>
    ))}
  </TabsList>
</div>
```

Each TabsTrigger is set to full width, allowing them to share the space equally.

That's it! You now have responsive tabs that can be scrolled horizontally when they overflow the container.
