Set up scripts for git workflow

Create a branch from another branch

```
git checkout -b myFeature dev
```

Creates the _MyFeature_ branch off _dev_. Do your work and then

```
git commit -am "Your message"
```

Now merge your changes to _dev_ without a fast-forward

```
git checkout dev
git merge --no-ff myFeature
```

Now push the changes to the server

```
git push origin dev
git push origin myFeature
```

And you'll see it how you want it.
