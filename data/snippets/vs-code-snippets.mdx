Install 'code' command in PATH

Ensure VS code is installed properly. Drag into Applications Folder. Sometimes the VSCode application might be in your `downloads` folder, so make sure to move it out of there.

Next, Open Visual Studio Code

1. Open the Visual Studio Code application, and type Command + Shift + P and type the command '**install code**'. Then enter it.
2. You will see the below message in Visual Studio Application: **shell command ' code' successfully installed in PATH.**
3. Now, jump to the [iTerm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITerm2) or  CLI and type _**code .**_

Then you will be able to redirect to Visual Studio Code for any code change/view.

Use the Uninstall 'code' command in the PATH command before the _"Install 'code' command in PATH"_ command


%% After executing the command, restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to simply type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder. The "." Simply means "current directory" %%

To add PATH permanently:

Add this to your `~/.bash_profile`, or to `~/.zshrc` if you are running [macOS v10.15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Catalina) (Catalina) or later.

Open the [~/.bashrc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Legacy-compatible_Bash_startup_example) file using [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) or [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29):

```
vi ~/.bashrc
```

Enter the following by pressing `i` to insert:
```
code () { VSCODE_CWD="$PWD" open -n -b "com.microsoft.VSCode" --args $* ;}
```
Save and exit the file using `Esc` + `:wq`

Reflect the settings in ~/.bashrc using the following command:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
